I'm building a Quiz Platform app for Anroid as my personal project.
My goal is to build a quiz platform that user can customize all aspects of Quiz UIs.
Like with making a quiz about lol worlds that was on first week of november, 
It would be nice if it has its own theme with Colors of T1.

Below video is my testing code at QuizCreationTest.kt, this is slowed down to check errors and steps running with my eye.
This code works as both test and generation for items.
Using this code, I can build quizzes with OpenAI and use this code for Quiz Generation.
