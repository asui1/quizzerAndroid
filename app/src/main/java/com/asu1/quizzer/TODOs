TODOs to app implementation
First aim to make app launchable without some features that are not essential.

- Implement Save and Upload QuizLayout.
1. Validate Check for empty fields.
-> For each quiz class, they need fun validationCheck() to check if they are valid. Also, implement fun check() to get whether they are right or wrong.
2. Change Item format to json format. -> Need to match format with flutter. Make dummy data for some items.
3. Upload to server.
4. Get response from server.
5. If success, show success message, reset viewmodels and move back to home.
6. If failed, show error message.

1. Make load function with quiz uuids.
2. Get response from server.
3. If success, get data and open quizSolver with it.

- Test Code to Generate Quizzes with AI gen datas.
This should be able to generate quizzes with AI generated data with provided json format of quiz contents.

- ColorScheme generation with Random Strength.
Generate Random ColorScheme should have a value from 0 to 5 to show how strong random color should be.

----------------
TODO For servers.
- Change Data Models.
Change Previous QuizLayout to QuizLayout + QuizTheme + ScoreCard.

- Register Nickname Dup check.
Current code when checking duplicate nicknames, it gets partial match. ABC and AB are considered same. This should be fixed.

- Implement Session token for search request.
I need session token to that user can request for more search results on current search request.

- Implement suggestion algorithm for search.
This should suggest user with similar search results. I will use LLM models with title, tags, and description.
