TODOs to app implementation
First aim to make app launchable without some features that are not essential.

- Implement Score Card decoration.
This will have image or color decoration with opengl.

- Implement Save and Upload QuizLayout.
This should save content as json format and match other previous items on server.

- Test Code to Generate Quizzes with AI gen datas.
This should be able to generate quizzes with AI generated data with provided json format of quiz contents.

- ColorScheme generation with Random Strength.
Generate Random ColorScheme should have a value from 0 to 5 to show how strong random color should be.

----------------
TODO For servers.

- Register Nickname Dup check.
Current code when checking duplicate nicknames, it gets partial match. ABC and AB are considered same. This should be fixed.

- Implement Session token for search request.
I need session token to that user can request for more search results on current search request.

- Implement suggestion algorithm for search.
This should suggest user with similar search results. I will use LLM models with title, tags, and description.
