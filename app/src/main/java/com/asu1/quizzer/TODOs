TODOs to app implementation
First aim to make app launchable without some features that are not essential.

- Test Code to Generate Quizzes with AI gen datas.
NEED FULL TEST WITH TITLE IMAGE, BODY FOR ALL QUIZZES
This should be able to generate quizzes with AI generated data with provided json format of quiz contents.

Home: Name, QuizCardList를 받는 형식으로 변경.

Trends: from 6am ~ next day 6am, get top 20 QuizCardList with most solves.

Stats: For this week, get to 20 users with most solves. If solve is same, then order by average score.
To do this, need data of: User nickname, User profile image, User total solves, User average score.

- Need Custom Toast message to beautify current default toast messages.

---------------MINIMUM FOR APP RELEASE----------------

- maybe put some gradients to color backgrounds at mainScreen to make it more beautiful.

----------------
TODO For servers.
- Implement Views for each quiz every day.
Then Keep Track of Views for Yesterday and Last Week.

- Implement suggestion algorithm for search.
-> Will be implemented Later...
This should suggest user with similar search results. I will use LLM models with title, tags, and description.
