TODOs to app implementation
First aim to make app launchable without some features that are not essential.

- Test Code to Generate Quizzes with AI gen datas.
This should be able to generate quizzes with AI generated data with provided json format of quiz contents.

- Need Custom Toast message to beautify current default toast messages.

- maybe put some gradients to color backgrounds at mainScreen to make it more beautiful.

----------------
TODO For servers.
- Implement Views for each quiz every day.
Then Keep Track of Views for Yesterday and Last Week.

- Implement suggestion algorithm for search.
-> Will be implemented Later...
This should suggest user with similar search results. I will use LLM models with title, tags, and description.
